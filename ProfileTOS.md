# osu!player profile TOS üìã
We will be completly honest with you. When you create a profile you allow us to save the information you just entered and store it until you delete your profile.

*You always have the right to delete your profile by using the delete option where you edit your profile!*

### Tell me, what do you collect from me 
Well lets make it and tell you everything.  
Because we can and want you to know what we save and do with your information.

**Example profile**
```
{
  "id": "<your GUID (not database ID)>",
  "name": "<your username>",
  "description": "<your description>",
  "role": <your userrole>,
  "joinDate": "<the date your joined>",
  "level": <your current level>,
  "xp": <current xp progress>,
  "totalXp": <totalxp>,
  "hasXpLock": <if true you are not able to gain XP>,
  "version": <the version you use, DEPRECATED>,
  "versionDate": "<the version you use>",
  "lastSeen": "<when you were the last time online>",
  "osuProfile": "<the osu!profile ID you gaved us>",
  "songsPlayed": <the amount of songs you played>,
  "isDonator": <if you are a donator>,
  "amountDonated": <how much you donated so far>,
  "customRolename": "<your custom rolename, donator feature>",
  "customRoleColor": "<your custom rolecolor, donator feature>",
  "customWebBackground": "<your custombanner url, for your web and client profile>",
  "profilePicture": "<if you have uploaded a profile picture, DEPRECATED>"
}
```
Your activity (XP and songs played) updates whenever you're listening to your songs, while beeing logged in.
The above information is publicly visible by visiting our [stats page](https://stats.founntain.dev) or by viewing profiles inside the client.

Thats all the data we store of you in our *database*, when you delete your profile the above object of you is gone and erased.  
Your profile picture will also be deleted when you delete your profile, obviously.

### ‚òùÔ∏è Some rules
Don't post anything NSFW, hate-/harmful in your description or somewhere else in the client. This also includes your profile picture. *(sorry about that, but no anime tiddies as profile picture)*  

‚ö†Ô∏è If for whatever reason you do so, we have the right to clear your description, remove your profile picture / banner or send your profile to the *sun (deleting it)*.

That's all. Amazing that you read this far here is a nice flower for you üå∫

If you agree and accept the above, you can continue creating your profile.  
***Have fun and enjoy your stay.***
